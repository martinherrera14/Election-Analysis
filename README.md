## Election-Audit Summary ##
Overall, the script given to us to calculate the total votes, votes by each county , and the total percentages each candidate recieved is useful to an extant . The **Election Commission** could use this script to determine the candidate winning the most counties in a state instead of trying to figure out the overall with few counties and candidates. Also the script can help us define where each voter came from to determine if the candidate should vist that county in the future to get re-elected again. Furthermore, the script can be modifed to a single city for candidates running for **city council** or **mayor**. We can expand our script into a business like **fast food** or **A Bussiness Postion** to determine who should take up what postion based on votes with in the city defining your stats.
